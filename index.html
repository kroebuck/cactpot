		<h1>Mini-Cactpot</h1>
		<p>Rules: The board consists of a 3x3 grid with the numbers 1-9 randomly assigned to a given location. One random location's number is initially revealed. Click on an unrevealed location to reveal the number for that spot. After you reveal 3 numbers (so that 4 numbers total are displayed), choose a row, column, or diagonal. Your score is the sum of the 3 numbers (including the hidden ones) in that chosen line.</p>
